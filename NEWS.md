# NEWS

* 0.0.1.1000 Added a `NEWS.md` file to track changes to the package. In addition, now included an _addplot_ function to simplify the logging of plots, also now the inclusion of scroll bars on tables is optional using a new _big=TRUE_ option in _addtable_. Have reverted to a developmental version number to reflect my dissatisfaction with the package, there are many improvements that can still be made.

* 0.0.1.950 exported _write_css_ and _write_head_, so they can be imported into other packages.
