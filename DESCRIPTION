Description: Contains code to include Cascading Style Sheet codes into a series of HTML files
    each of which constitutes a tab into a Home HTML file. Initially this is designed for use
    with the Abalone projects I am working on but I will will also work to generalize this for
    any project that could generate graphics and tables. Currently tables are not implemented 
    and the grpahics files need to be .png files.
