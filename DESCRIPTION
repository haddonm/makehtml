Description: Contains code to include Cascading Style Sheet codes into a series of HTML files
    each of which constitutes a tab into a Home HTML file. Initially this is designed for use
    with the Abalone projects I am working on but I will will also work to generalize this for
    any project that could generate graphics and tables. The graphics files need to be .png files.
    This is still under development but can be used currently.
