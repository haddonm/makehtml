\description{
make_html writes a set of HTML files with tabbed
    navigation, with each tab containing the results relating to a
    given set of results or diagnostics from a particular aMSE run.
    This code was borrowed from Ian Taylor's r4ss, but has been
    extensively modified to improve both the css (see write_css)
    and the HTML. By default, this function will look in the
    results directory where PNG files were created for a
    resultTable_runname.csv file with the name 'runname' written
    added by aMSE. HTML files are written to link to these plots
    and put in the same directory.
