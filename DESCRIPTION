Description: Contains code to include Cascading Style Sheet codes into a series of HTML files
    each of which constitutes a tab into a Home HTML file. Initially this is designed for use
    with the Abalone projects I am working on but it will also work for any project that 
    could generate graphics and tables. The graphics files need to be .png files.
    Much of the original code was extracted from r4ss written by Ian Taylor, a few fixes to the 
    HTML tags and tweaks to the CSS generator, and generalized to apply to results from
    any project.
